# Fixed-TU Jacobians and the arithmetic boundary

These primary sources were checked on 2026-10-09. They provide definitions
and background; the arbitrary-modulus proof is written independently in
[the repository proof record](../proof/regular-modular-bicycle.md).
This contribution does not claim the fixed-TU theorem is new literature.

## Total unimodularity

Michel X. Goemans, *Linear Programming and Polyhedral Combinatorics*,
MIT 18.453 notes, April 5, 2017,
[Section 3.5, Definition 3.12](https://math.mit.edu/~goemans/18453S17/polyhedral.pdf).

The definition requires every square minor to be zero or a unit.
A full-row-rank TU matrix therefore has a unit maximal minor. The local
proof constructs an integral right inverse directly from that minor.

## Regular-matroid Jacobian

Spencer Backman, Matthew Baker, and Chi Ho Yuen,
*Geometric Bijections for Regular Matroids, Zonotopes, and Ehrhart Theory*,
[arXiv:1701.01051](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01051),
[PDF, Section 2.1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01051).

Proposition 2.1.2 identifies the edge-lattice Jacobian quotient with
$\operatorname{coker}(AA^\top)$ through $[\gamma]\mapsto[A\gamma]$.
This supplies context for calling the Gram cokernel a regular-matroid
group. The local modular proof establishes its explicit torsion maps and
modulus compatibility without importing representation uniqueness.

The theorem relating different TU representations of the same labeled
regular matroid remains a separate source and proof obligation in Phase 3.

## Torsion-free and surjective arithmetic matroids

Roberto Pagaria and Giovanni Paolini,
*Representations of torsion-free arithmetic matroids*,
[arXiv:1908.04137](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04137),
[PDF, Section 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04137).

Section 2 distinguishes torsion-free, $m(\varnothing)=1$, from surjective,
$m(E)=1$. It describes a torsion-free representation as integer vectors in
an ambient lattice and defines equivalence in Definition 2.5.
Those definitions permit $A=[2]$ in $\mathbb Z$: it is torsion-free but
not surjective. The [local counterexample](../proof/arithmetic-torsion-model-obstruction.md)
then gives an elementary obstruction to an unconditional torsion-group
model. It does not compare two realizations with matching arithmetic data.

## Independent exact Smith factors

The determinantal-divisor oracle reuses the all-minor characterization
already sourced in [the graph background record](graph-critical-group-background.md).
It does not use the theorem map to determine expected torsion or classes.
